\
**it looks seriously like it's not going to work**\
and already
#### i'm getting quite irritable about stuff like having line numbers when i haven't fucking well asked for them
\
**if** you know what i mean\
no, but to all intents and purposes it works, and all that remains to be done is to test if i have the ability to make lists...\
\
- a list is a circle ![a list is not a circle](1439135907129.jpeg)
- without a beginning
- and nobody knows
- where the list begins...\

~~and of course there is no way to end such a thing~~\
i had the exact same problem before...\
1. i had the same problem before
2. and i knew exactly what i was going to do about it
3. i was going to shout it from the rooftops:-

- it's just incredible to have fun with anyone
- it's just impossible to have vun with anyvun
- and when i see you hanging around with anyone
- it's just insensible to see me fly!
- i just wanna pie!

but i guess the important thing\
the truly important thing\
