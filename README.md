## a second-level heading
javascript structures/functions that help with contenteditable elements\
you know, i **love _writing_** things down in the ether!\
\
love it, you say?\
well yes! i **_diddly_ do**!\
\
there's also the ~~quite~~ <ins>hypertexty</ins> <sup>way of doing things</sup>... the way that everyone with <sub>deep voices</sub> loves\
you know the kind of shit...\
\
sometimes, though, i also love to quote 
> text that others have come up with, and yet i cannot specify what colour it should be in... nor what size it should be...

and if, for example, this text of which i speak is code\
```written in coding language of some sort...```
### i also love to link
but for some reason i have no table of contents or list capabilities here, do i?\
moreover, This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).\
and i **do** find it soothing to link back to what has gone before... in the past... [ever so long ago...](#celib)\
\
ok so that doesn't work, so what i'm going to do is what you should always do when you're in a git environment and you don't want to go on with the thing you're doing... let's say you hit a reef or something - run aground or what-have-you: you simply have to save your changes with a commit and a commit message
